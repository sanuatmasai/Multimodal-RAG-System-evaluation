# Multimodal RAG System
# Objective
# Build a FastAPI-based RAG system that processes multimodal documents (text, images, tables) and provides accurate retrieval-augmented responses.

# Core Requirements
# 1. FastAPI Service
# RESTful API with proper documentation
# Async operations and error handling
# Health checks and logging
# 2. Multimodal Processing
# Documents: PDF, DOCX, HTML support
# Images: Extract, describe, and embed visual content
# Tables: Parse structure, maintain relationships
# Text: Chunk and process textual content
# 3. Vector Database
# Store multimodal embeddings
# Support semantic search across content types
# Maintain metadata and source attribution
# 4. RAG Pipeline
# Ingestion: Upload → Extract → Embed → Index
# Retrieval: Query → Search → Rank → Context
# Generation: Retrieved context → LLM → Response with citations
# Required Endpoints
# POST /documents/upload     # Upload and process documents
# GET /documents/           # List processed documents
# POST /query              # RAG queries
# GET /health             # System status

# Evaluation Criteria
# Functionality

# All endpoints ware orking correctly
# Accurate multimodal content extraction

# Implementation Quality

# Clean, maintainable code
# Proper async/await usage
# Comprehensive error handling
# Good API design
# Performance & Architecture

# Meeting response time requirements
# Scalable system design
# Efficient vector operations
# Production-ready deployment
# Deliverables
# Complete FastAPI application
# Vector database configuration
# API documentation with examples
